# qvd-reader
Javascript utility to read QVD files.
This utility can be used to read QVD files generated by Qlik View and Qlik Sense.

## Installation
```sh
npm install qvd-reader
```

## Dependencies
```
xml-js
```
#### Important
 - I do not recommend its use for production usage, use it by your own risk.
 - I do not recommend its use for large QVD files, it may contain bugs or lead to performance issues.
 - I build this package with the help of this github repo, created by Mikhail Korolev (korolmi), you can find it [here](https://github.com/korolmi/qvdfile), it shows the overall and detailed structure of a QVD file and tells you how to read it.
 - I will add a write method in this package in the future.
 - If you find any issue or bug please let me know and I will try to fix it.


# Doc
The package generates an array of objects that contains the fields of the QVD as properties in the objects, spaces in the field names will be replaced by underscore character, example: "Last Name" -> "Last_Name".

Example code:
``` JS
const QVD = require('qvd-reader');

const data = QVD.read('PruebaNull.qvd');

console.log(data);

// Result
[
  { Num: 10, Nulo: null },
  { Num: 9.9, Nulo: null },
  { Num: 9, Nulo: null },
  { Num: 8, Nulo: null },
  { Num: 7, Nulo: null },
  { Num: 6, Nulo: null }
]
```
